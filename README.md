Hello there ! I'm releasing a free edited fivem base with esx-legacy 1.6 compatible and made for Quasar Inventory 1.4 with 1.2 patch.

How can I install it ?

--> Download :

download this repository, latest fivem artifact and also download [inventory] assets from keymaster.fivem.net
don't forget to download quasar's progressbar. (https://github.com/quasar-scripts/progressbar)
--> Setup :

config the server.cfg file, install the artifact, drop the inventory asset somewhere in /resources .
start xampp and create your database(utf8_general_ci), import legacy.sql and then inventory sql.
Config anything else you would like to change.
--> Run it:

try to start the server, be patient the first time and check if there are any errors..
and enjoy your new server ! :)

What changed from the latest release ?

--> Fixes/Updated resources :

Obviously a lot of esx scripts were update (hehe ^^), check esx-legacy 1.6 changelog for more informations.
Oxmysql is now updated to v2.3.0 since 1.6V2.

--> ESX.SavePlayer and ESX.SavePlayers :
- Have been modified to save players and inventory once in a while.

--> getInventory :
- Also been edited to match with the new patch.


That's all ! basically nothing more than my last esx-legacy release for Quasar Inventory. This free edit is nothing than a little nudge to help you to launch your first server with the inventory.
