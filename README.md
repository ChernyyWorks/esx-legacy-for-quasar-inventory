Hello there !
I'm releasing a free edited fivem base with esx-legacy 1.6 compatible and made for Quasar Inventory.


How can I install it ?

--> Download :
- download this repository, latest fivem artifact and also download [inventory] assets from keymaster.fivem.net
- don't forget to download quasar's progressbar. (https://github.com/quasar-scripts/progressbar)

--> Setup :
- config the server.cfg file, install the artifact, drop the inventory asset somewhere in /resources .
- start xampp and create your database(utf8_general_ci), import legacy.sql and then inventory sql.
- Config anything else you would like to change.

--> Run it:
- try to start the server, be patient the first time and check if there are any errors..
- and enjoy your new server ! :)

--------------------------------------
What changed from the latest release (legacy 1.5 version) ?

--> Updated resources :
- Obviously a lot of esx scripts were update (hehe ^^), check esx-legacy 1.6 changelog for more informations.
- Oxmysql is now updated to v2.1.1 (no need think about it when installing Quasar-smartphone.)

--> Some commands were edited/removed :
- giveweapon ammo arg was removed of the command, inventory doesn't support it. (now : /giveweapon 'id' 'weaponname')
- /group and /job were removed too, /info does the same thing and also prints the player name so it's useless.

--> Casino and Bob74 IPL :
- Now you can enter in the casino, and some other native mapping.


(If you want, you can type 'Quasar' in vscode and you will find all modifications.)

--------------------------------------
That's all ! basically nothing more than my last esx-legacy release for Quasar Inventory.
This free edit is nothing than a little nudge to help you to launch your first server with the inventory.
As mentioned before I'm not selling anything ! At the beginning, I only wanted to share my personal base because I received a few messages on discord of people having troubles with the installation of 1.5 esx-legacy and I wanted to help them by sharing my files.
Now legacy 1.6 was released, I uptaded my little work. Hope you enjoy it !
